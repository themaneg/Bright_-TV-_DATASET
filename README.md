1. Project Summary
This project provides data-driven insights on BrightTV's user base and usage trends. It identifies key factors influencing consumption, recommends strategies to boost viewership, and proposes initiatives to grow the user base, all based on a comprehensive SQL query analysis.

2. Key Insights from the Analysis
User & Usage Trends: The analysis provides a detailed view of the user base by location (province), demographics (race, gender), and age cohorts. It also highlights daily and hourly viewing patterns and identifies the top-performing content.

Factors Influencing Consumption: Insights from the analysis and external research show that viewership is driven by factors such as:

Content and Variety: A wide range of high-quality content that aligns with user interests.

Convenience: The ability to access content anytime, anywhere, and on various devices.

Cost: Pricing and perceived value for money.

Demographics: Age, income, and education level are strong predictors of viewership.

Binge-Watching: This behavior is a significant driver of consumption and engagement.

3. Strategic Recommendations
To increase consumption and grow the user base, the following initiatives are recommended:

Content Strategy:

Schedule new releases of high-performing content on low-consumption days to drive traffic.

Launch exclusive live events and original content.

Acquire or create content tailored to demographics and age groups with low engagement.

User Base Growth Initiatives:

Implement targeted social media marketing campaigns, leveraging short-form video content.

Offer free trials and promotions to attract new subscribers.
